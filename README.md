Time Difference of Arrival Analysis for LoRa measurements

The purpose of this project is to provide a solution for passive positioning of radio transmitters by using several receivers placed with different known positions and accurate timing (GPS, ...). Originally this software was used for passively tracking experimental rockets equipped with LoRa transmitters. By using LoRa transmitters and receivers a longitude/latitude accuracy in the order of 100 m is possible.
